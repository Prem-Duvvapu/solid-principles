# SOLID Principles in Java  

The **SOLID** principles are five design principles that help in writing maintainable, scalable, and clean object-oriented code.

## ðŸ”¹ S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)  
**A class should have only one reason to change.**  
ðŸ‘‰ Each class should focus on a single responsibility to improve maintainability.  

## ðŸ”¹ O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)  
**Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.**  
ðŸ‘‰ Extend functionality via inheritance or interfaces without modifying existing code.  

## ðŸ”¹ L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)  
**Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.**  
ðŸ‘‰ Derived classes should not break the behavior of the parent class.  

## ðŸ”¹ I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)  
**Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.**  
ðŸ‘‰ Split large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones.  

## ðŸ”¹ D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)  
**High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.**  
ðŸ‘‰ Depend on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete implementations.

### ðŸ“Œ Why SOLID?  
Following SOLID principles leads to better **code maintainability, scalability, and flexibility**, making development smoother and reducing bugs.  

ðŸš€ **Happy Coding!**
